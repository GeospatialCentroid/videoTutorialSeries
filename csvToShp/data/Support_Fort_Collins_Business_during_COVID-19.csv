My approach to the world pandemic is simple. I will shoot your headshots outdoors. My studio is small and standing 6 feet from me without a mask or far enough away is not ideal. In the case of inclement weather I am flexible. If it's windy and you have longer hair that would be affected, we can reschedule. If it's very cold and your cheeks turn red, I can fix that! The great thing about my work and my skill is that I can shoot you in almost any environment/setting.
